            Questions to ruminate
        </h1>

        <p>
            What do you do with violence in your memory? <br>
            What do you do when memory could be the driver of violence (is it just?) <br>
            How do we consider memory as it connects to the present day? Who bears the burden of
             memory when harm has long passed? To whom is justice owed? <br>
             What do you do when justice is no longer impacting those directly harmed 
             but rather the memory that has persisted through generations? <br>
